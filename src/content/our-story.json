    "title": "The Legend of Barcelos",
    "content": "Legend has it, years ago, a pilgrim was passing through the town of Barcelos in Portugal. Wrongfully accused of a crime and sentenced to hang, he was brought before a judge about to sit down to his roasted chicken dinner. 'If this rooster gets up and crows, then I'm an innocent man' - exclaimed the pilgrim. And that is exactly what happened! The pilgrim was freed and so the Barcelos Legend was born.",
    "moral": "We've passed this story on through generations and with it, treasured recipes, time-tested practices, and age-old traditions. No gimmicks or imitations. At Barcelos, we value authenticity and stay true to our Afro-Portuguese roots when it comes to our flame-grilled chicken and our original Peri-Peri marinades.",
